# USA Map Injection Mold
This project presents the creation of an injection mold part featuring a "God Bless America" engraving on a USA map silhouette. Starting from a hand-drawn image, the design was processed in MATLAB to extract vector outlines and convert them into DXF format, which was then used for CAD modeling and mold design.

It includes:
- Image vectorization and conversion to DXF format using MATLAB
- SolidWorks part design based on DXF profiles
- Toolpath generation and G-code creation for CNC manufacturing
- Setup sheet documentation for the CNC process
